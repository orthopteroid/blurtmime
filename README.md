Articulatory Phonetics using hidden Markov Processes

The code here is just a concept demo of an idea. The original idea was to make interesting names of D&D characters that were fun to say by making your mouth make interesting sounds. It would be neat to build a tiny audio renderer into this app that could serve a short audio file in addition to the IPA symbology.

Play around with the app on http://blurtmime.appspot.com
